## Project Purpose
This currently only an exemplary repository of how to measure certain aspects of data quality (non-comprehensive). There 
are specific [data quality deminsions]() that we have identified as being 'low hanging fruit' to model and measure data 
quality for certain projects and datasets.

## Project structure
Due to lack of development and understanding of the data quality domain across Sumup, the project structure is 
segregated by squad (each squad provides DQ dimension examples). 

**Currently the following squads formally support this repository:**
* [Onsite-Tracking](https://sumupteam.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEV/pages/1575256107/Onsite+Tracking+Squad)
* [Analytical Data Warehouse (aDWH)](https://sumupteam.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEV/pages/1579090238/Analytical+DWH+Squad)
