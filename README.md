## Project Purpose
This is currently only an exemplary repository of how to measure certain aspects of data quality (non-comprehensive). There 
are specific [data quality deminsions]() that we have identified as being 'low hanging fruit' to model and measure data 
quality for certain projects and datasets.

## Project structure
Due to lack of development and understanding of the data quality domain across Sumup, the project structure is 
segregated by squad (each squad provides DQ dimension examples) to enable use to explore these dimensions autonomously.

**Currently the following squads formally support this repository:**
* [Onsite-Tracking](https://sumupteam.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEV/pages/1575256107/Onsite+Tracking+Squad)
* [Analytical Data Warehouse (aDWH)](https://sumupteam.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEV/pages/1579090238/Analytical+DWH+Squad)
